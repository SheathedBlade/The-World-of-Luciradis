description: Once, a wayward family found shelter and solace upon the world's nest of leaves, only to be pulled into unending conflict and strife. The girl seeks freedom from traditions forced upon her by her father, and finds a boy who wished the same. They stayed together, exploring every leaf that grew upon the nest, but the cruel passage of time soon tested the boy's will to live, and became disillusioned with his life. So, until he finds purpose in himself, she will explore, in his stead, past the small nest of leaves, daring to travel beyond the blanket of stars dotting the night sky - to worlds beyond the grasp of the roots of Luciradis.

"That you would even deign to return here speaks volumes of your arrogance." A voice in the dark makes its presence known the moment I stepped foot into the cavern. *Just as grating as I remember.*

The dragon's abode rises from their slumber, each with their luminous eyes populating the dark cavern. They gaze towards me, the now-returned daughter of the broodmaster.

"I had the mind to come here one last time before I depart," I respond nonchalantly. The voice in the darkness grows quiet, as if contemplating, before igniting the ceiling light fixtures with its breath of flames, illuminating the room with a bright gold hue.

"Leave, brethren. I would speak to my kin in private." The draconic broodmaster's order is simple, and soon, the nest of dragons heed its command and vacated the cavern. I now face the voice's owner, whose blindingly white scales glisten underneath the golden flames.

"It's been a while, Father." I take step forward, the footstep echoing across the room, breaking the awkward silence. "What is it now...three thousand years? You look none worse for wear."
