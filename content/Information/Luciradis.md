Luciradis is the name of the world that we inhabit. Its name roughly translates to "shining root", which dates back to the creation of this world.

All beings of Luciradis currently follow a system of time concocted by the joint efforts of the respective first Avatars of the Protean Concepts: [[Protean Concepts#The Convergence|the Convergence]] and [[Protean Concepts#The Matrix|the Matrix]].
