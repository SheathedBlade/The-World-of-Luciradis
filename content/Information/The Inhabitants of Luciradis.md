# Humanoid Races
## Akumari

> "Akumaros" is the plural version of this word.

The akumaros are a rare race; not native to Cicatri Ciel, but from the southern lands beyond the horizon. They first immigrated to Cicatri Ciel, and set their roots down on what is now known today as the [[Azamuku Domain]]. While the vast majority of its population is not of Akumari descent, pure Akumari individuals garner immense respect within their communities.

>*// K.M. edit //*  
>The ancestral homeplace of the akumaros is in the frigid mountains of **Gokan**, where the developed city of **[[Ifuri]]** takes root. Before the **Cicatri Emigration**, Ifuri was just one of many nomadic Akumari settlements. One could say an Ifurian akumari is much more traditional than those one would find at the Azamuku Domain.

The most defining physical characteristic of an Akumari is their pair of horns protruding from their head. While the style of horn can vary, this will always be the first thing anyone can use to identify an Akumari. Generally, the color of their horns stay consistent to darker tones, such as black, brown, and deep red.

The akumaros have a natural affinity to cold weather, their skin having been evolved to retain the individual's body heat as much as possible. Of course, extreme cold weather would require them to wear conventional winter gear, but chilly weather is not enough for an akumari to wear much more than a jacket.

## Elf

The elves are respecters of the natural order of Luciradis. Overly concerned with the maintenance of nature, the elves are inherently born with the ability to *"hear"* nature, and are only second to the [[The Inhabitants of Luciradis#Terrakin|Terrakin]] when it comes to utilizing invocations that draw power directly from the **Root of Earth**.

The elves are an introverted race, tending to keep to themselves in most public affairs. The majority of the elven population lies in the [[Ferros Republic]], a haven for elves situated in a dense forest between two large rivers. Only a few groups of elves venture outside the Republic, though it is made difficult to do so due to the intervention of the ruling sovereigns.

The society of the elves in the Ferros Republic can be broken down as thus: the **sovereign elves**, the **industrious elves**, and the **drifting elves**. These monikers are usually tied to the particular family of elves, making it difficult for elves to grow out of their titles. In rare circumstances, however, the status of an elf in the Ferros Republic can change with approval of the ruling sovereign elves.

> It is important to note that these are just titles given to elves. There are no physical/visual differences between the classes of elves in the Ferros Republic.

For elves that exist outside the Ferros Republic, these titles rarely matter to them, as it reeks of rigidity and tradition. Those that leave the Republic rarely ever are allowed back in, so elves that do leave take up residence in other nations.

### Sovereign Elf

The sovereign elves are a minority of elves enjoying the luxuries of being high-class individuals in other nations. They are often the ruling class of elves, dictating the path of the Republic as they see fit. They often take the role of advisors, academic mentors, and other privileged occupations.

The title of sovereign elf is a bit flexible, as the ruling party of sovereign elves can congregate and promote an individual to the status of sovereign elf. These are rare occasions, however, for the circumstances must be right in order to gain this status.
### Industrious Elf

An industrious elf is equivalent to a working class individual. They are not as well-read or educated as a sovereign elf, but they are needed for society to function at its core. Occupations such as smiths, farmers, and crafters are some of the many roles that industrious elves partake in.

Although the elves are discouraged from leaving the Republic, the sovereign elves have deemed **merchants** as a necessary occupation in order to maintain the Republic's economy. Therefore, only a very small subset of industrious elves become merchants and they are allowed to come in and out of the Republic with official travel documentation.
### Drifting Elf

Drifting elves are, for a lack of a better term, exiled from the Ferros Republic. Despite the seemingly serious nature of this title, it simply refers to any elf that leaves the Republic for any unofficial reason. Given that it is very difficult for anyone to enter or leave the Republic, the title is quite fitting, as drifting elves have no place or purpose in the Republic's society. The sovereign elves don't necessarily keep track of who is a drifting elf, but guards at the gate will turn away any elf that tries to re-enter the Republic without official authority of the sovereign elves.

## Human

## Luxori

> Luxori is both a singular and plural noun.

The Luxori are a race with powers descended from the Concept of the [[Protean Concepts#The Illuminator|Illuminator]]. Originally, these individuals were humans from the time before **the Scarring**, but with the Illuminator's magic, the humans that followed the Illuminator during the Scarring obtained a natural talent for light-based magic. This large community of humans would become the Luxori, beginning its roots on a landmass named after them: [[Luxor Citadel|Luxor]].

The appearance of a Luxori bears a striking resemblance to that of a human's, but the Luxori have **symmetrical dark markings** all over their torso and limbs, with some individuals being born with some markings on the face. This is a unique trait of the Luxori, an evolutionary development borne from subsequent generations of Luxori. These dark markings on the body enhances the powers of the Illuminator, **illuminating these dark markings up to a vibrant, golden color** whenever the Luxori individual would use light-based invocations. The intensity of the brightness of the color would depend on the strength of the invocation being cast.

## Terrakin

## Vyrian

> *// K.M. edit //*  
> This section has been added to reflect the current state of Luciradis's inhabitants.
> Related: [[#Dragon]]

Vyrians are a humanoid hybrid race descended from the dragons, claiming and recycling the original nomenclature **"Hryvernus"** for their own identification. Most Vyrians have appeared on [[Nova Ciel]], having migrated from [[Cicatri Ciel]] around 8000 ASC alongside most of the population of Cicatri Ciel.

Vyrians take on a human appearance, with draconic aspects sprinkled in. Namely, a Vyrian has the horns and the tail inherited from their parents at random. The color of its scales are randomly inherited from either of the parents. The skin scales are a trait only seen on the [[Saria Pulse|very first Vyrian]]. The Vyrians that have been born after her, when the idea became popularized, have no such scales on the skin. As such, Vyrians are often confused with [[#Akumari|Akumaros]], another horned race. The difference, however, is that Akumaros do not possess tails.

While the conception of a Vyrian from a pure dragon and human couple is still being researched, the conception of a Vyrian from Vyrian parents operates as how a humanoid race would conceive a child.

# Bestial Races

## Dragon

The dragons are an extraterrestrial, intelligent race of winged, scaled beasts. While these beasts weren't initially called as such, "dragon" is a term coined by the native inhabitants of Luciradis to describe the species in general. The original nomenclature of the dragons is still used within communities of dragons, however it is never used in conversation with other non-draconic inhabitants, deferring to "dragon" as the easier way to communicate.

> The original nomenclature, as one of our researchers found out, is "Hryvernus", or "Hryverni" as plural.

Of the existing dragons, there are several clans of dragons that exist, similar to tribes or nations. The most dominant clan is the Arodraenix clan, which is aptly named for the ancient dragon, Arodraenix, the Concept of the [[Protean Concepts#The Shimmering Wings|Shimmering Wings]]. This clan secludes itself on top of the [[Grandiose Peaks]], located on the western island of Cicatri Ciel (which is home to the [[Azamuku Domain]]).
