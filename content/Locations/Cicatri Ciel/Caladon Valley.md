description: "Unassuming on the surface, the miners of Stalwryn paid no heed to the valley, preferring to excavate the usual metals and precious stones such as iron, gold, silver, etc. A prospective miner, Rory Caladon, took the plunge and unearthed what would spark the next generation of industrialization: a metal whose durability is without competition. And so the metal and its valley were aptly named after its excavator."
