title: Cicatri Ciel
---
Cicatri Ciel describes the group of landmasses located in the northern hemisphere of Luciradis. Roughly translating to *"Scarred Sky"* in ancient tongues, this name was conceived after the catastrophic event known as *The Scarring*, where a war between god-like beings have sundered the once-whole landmass apart.
