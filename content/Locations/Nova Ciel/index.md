title: Nova Ciel
---
Nova Ciel is the name of the group of landmasses in the southern hemisphere. Roughly translating to *"New Sky"*, its people opted to follow the naming convention that the ancestors of *Cicatri Ciel* used, in which it describes the skies above the land following the sentiments of its peoples. The early pioneers of *Cicatri Ciel* fled from the war-torn lands, and arrived on *Nova Ciel* with the intent of starting anew.
