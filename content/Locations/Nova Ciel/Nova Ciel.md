*Published by the Independent Journal of Historians, Nova Ciel*

## Etymology

***Nova Ciel*** roughly translates to *"New Sky"*, and it describes the landmass south of ***[[Cicatri Ciel]]***. This follows the naming convention that our ancestors of *Cicatri Ciel* used, in which it describes the skies above the land following the sentiments of its peoples. The early pioneers of *Cicatri Ciel* fled from the war-torn lands, and arrived on *Nova Ciel* with the intent of starting anew.

The landmass itself did not have a formal name before the arrival of the Cicatri emigrants.
