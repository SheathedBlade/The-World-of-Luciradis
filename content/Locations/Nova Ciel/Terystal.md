*Terystal: a fusion of modernity and tradition. Its location was the last destination of the ancient Akumari nomads: at the base of a large river known as the "[[Mōretsa River|Mōretsa]]". Since the Cicatri Emigration, travelers from that war-torn land have mingled with the locals, and set foundations for a city alongside the river. Though the old, ancient structures were eventually replaced by towering high-rises, the customs and traditions of the Akumari thrive still, as its people, both Akumari and otherwise, strive to make the land, now known as Terystal, into the foremost technological capital of Nova Ciel.*
